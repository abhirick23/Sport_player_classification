It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” published in 2001.

The repository has the models stored in XML files, and can be read with the OpenCV methods. These include models for face detection, eye detection, upper body and lower body detection, license plate detection etc. Below we see some of the concepts proposed by Viola and Jones in their research.

Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
